Damn those eyes, they keep me torn inside
She runs like a river through me, always you
Eyes don't lie, words may try
She comes like a mystery, flows through me
And I swear it's true, always you

I wish I could run into you now, yeah
I wish I could run into you now

If I see you one more time
Maybe I'd feel better, yeah, oh
If I see you one more time
Maybe I'd feel not so cold

Damn those eyes, no matter how I try
She brings with her, symphony over me
Words may try, I said, eyes don't lie
And she speaks with her tender voice, till there's no choice
And I swear it's true, always you, yeah, yeah

I wish I could run into you now, yeah
I wish I could run into you now

If I see you one more time
Maybe I'd feel better
If I see you one more time
Maybe I'd feel better

Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, better

See you one more time, hold you one more time
Baby, yeah, baby, baby, yeah, baby, baby
I see you, I want to hold you and maybe I'd feel better

If I see you one more time
Maybe I'd feel better
If I see you one more time
Maybe I'd feel, maybe I'd feel a whole lot better
